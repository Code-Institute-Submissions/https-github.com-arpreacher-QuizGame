### Unfixed Bugs

Alert message is unable to dynamically check the radio button input of true value therefore the program submission of messages that validates the input is not functional.
Console output of const 'inputs' provide accurate results of selected answers from the checked radio button (i.e isans: true or false)
The DOM correctly shows the value of true/false but the alert functions doesn't get the value from the selected butoon.
